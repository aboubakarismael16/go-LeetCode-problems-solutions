Self-assembled organic nanofibers for photovoltaic applications

###3.

Abstract:

The project aims fundamental research on the photovoltaic applications of self assembled
organic nanofibers. The ability of small organic molecules to form nanostructures will be
investigated in order to enhance the efficiency of photovoltaic cells. The morphology of
the polymer-nanostructures blends will be analyzed by means of X-Ray diffraction,
atomic force microscopy and near field optical microscopy. Photophysical properties will
be studied using various spectroscopic methods including time resolved
photoluminecence spectroscopy and pump-probe techniques. Finally, efficient devices
based on the optimized composite materials will be fabricated.

Nowadays organic solar cells based on a bilayer structure or a bulk heterojunction
of donor and acceptor materials have several times lower efficiency compared to their
inorganic counterparts (maximal efficiencies of 7% and 30% respectively [1]). Their
poor performance originates mainly from short exciton diffusion length and low charge
carrier mobilities. However, organic photovoltaic cells can be processed from solution,
which enables possibility of cheap mass production such as roll to roll and ink jet
printing.
Low dimensional nanostructures of organic materials can enhance the
photovoltaic performances. They can be designed to have high crystallinity, which will
facilitate directional exciton diffusion and charge transport. On the other hand they still
can be processed from solution for low cost fabrication.
One dimensional nanomaterials, for instance nanotubes and nanofibers are
currently attracting special attention due to 2D confinement, 1D transport of excitons and
charges, and the potential to be used as functional components in miniaturized
optoelectronic devices in the future. We propose to utilize the
properties of 1D organic materials in order to improve the efficiency of organic solar
cells.
Self assembled nanofibers of small organic molecules exhibit high charge carrier
mobility and exciton delocalization along the nanofiber, moreover there is an opportunityof tuning their optoelectronic properties, such as absorption spectrum and the efficiency
of the exciton dissociation process at the interface by modifying the lateral size of the
nanofiber.

The ability of PDI derivatives to form nanofibers in the blends with P3HT
polymer will be studied. Samples will be fabricated using various methods with the
ultimate goal to obtain nanofibers embedded into the polymer matrix and oriented mostly
perpendicular to the surface of the substrate – geometry ideal for the solar cell.
We propose to study application of the following methods to achieve the desired
morphology:
i)
processing from the solution (spincoating or doctor blading) with
external electrical field applied perpendicular to the substrate in order
to orient the nanofibers 
ii)
processing from the solution onto a precursor layer of perylene diimide
derivatives to which nanofibers formed in the solution should attach
due to π- π interactions,
iii)
vapor deposition teqhniques.
Samples with the nanofibers oriented in the plane of substrate will be also
fabricated using vertical spincoating technique , or orientation in applied electric
field .
Research on the samples anisotropy will provide additional information on the
mechanisms of charge transport and exciton dissociation in this class of materials. The
composites with the nanofibers oriented in the plane of the substrate are attractive
materials for polarization sensitive light detection in field effect transistor geometry.

Structural analysis of the fabricated films of P3HT –PDI nanofibers will be
performed using X-ray techniques, AFM (atomic force microscopy), SNOM (scanning
near field optical microscopy ). The spatial orientation of the fibers embedded into
the polymer will be determined by probing the samples with polarized light .
In order to improve solar cell performance following material properties should
be optimized: exciton lifetime, diffusion and delocalization lengths, efficiency of the
exciton dissociation at the nanofiber-polymer interface, charge-carrier mobilities. In order
to shed light on the behavior of the excitons and charges in this class of materials theproblem will be tackled using wide range of experimental techniques. Measurement of
the exciton lifetime will help to understand and improve the exciton dissociation process.
The efficiency of charge generation by light in the material will be investigated using
pump-probe and photoinduced absorption techniques. Charge carrier mobilities will be
extracted from the measurement of microwave conductivity , the method that allows
to eliminate the influence of the electrodes.

Academically, this will involve making a scientific research contribution. Indeed, many persons have worked on the issue and get out very good results. 
In fact, I would like to work with team to make more contribution on this filed and then Turkey is this best one place to achieve this hope.
